Introduction
============

**Open Producten** is a modern, open-source data- and services-layer to store
product and producttype information. Open Producten offers
structured data storage and services in line with the `Common Ground`_ model.

.. _`Common Ground`: https://commonground.nl/

Open Producten exposes several :ref:`API's<api_index>` to store and retrieve data:

* Producten API
* Producttype API

The `Notificaties API`_ is required for Open Producten to work if notifications are enabled, but is available as
a separate package, `Open Notificaties`_.
