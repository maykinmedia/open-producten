Open Producten Documentation
============================

**Open Producten** is an application where product types and products can be
managed in a single place. Other applications like `Open Inwoner`_ and `Open
Formulieren`_ can integrate **Open Producten** using its REST API to for example show
producttype information, create products or to get the current price for a
producttype.
